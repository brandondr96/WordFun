# WordFun
Program which gives the user the ability to get data given input words.

### Usage
This is a relatively simple program which uses random seeds to provide unique results per use. The anagram generator functions best for shorter words, since the random choices often fail to reach the longest possible outcomes with the default parameters. Additionally, the fact generator requires an internet connection for full functionality.
